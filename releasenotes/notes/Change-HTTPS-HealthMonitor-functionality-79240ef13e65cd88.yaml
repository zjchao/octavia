features:
  - |
    New Health Monitor type "TLS-HELLO" to perform a simple TLS connection.
upgrade:
  - |
    If users have configured Health Monitors of type "HTTPS" and are expecting
    a simple "TLS-HELLO" check, they will need to recreate their monitor with
    the new "TLS-HELLO" type.
fixes:
  - |
    Health Monitor type "HTTPS" now correctly performs the configured check.
    This is done with all certificate validation disabled, so it will not work
    if backend members are performing client certificate validation.
