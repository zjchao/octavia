upgrade:
  - Added option 'sync_provisioning_status' to enable synchronizing provisioning status 
    of loadbalancers with the neutron-lbaas database. Enabling this option will queue one
    additional message per amphora every heartbeat interval.
fixes:
  - Resolved an issue that could cause provisioning status to become out of sync between
    neutron-lbaas and octavia during high load.
