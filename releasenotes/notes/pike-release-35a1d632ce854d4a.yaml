    For the OpenStack Pike release, the Octavia team is excited to announce
    Octavia version 1.0.0 and introduce the Octavia v2 API.  Octavia can now
    be deployed without neutron-lbaas as a standalone endpoint.  The
    Octavia v2 API is fully backward compatible with the neutron-lbaas v2 API
    and is a superset of the neutron-lbaas v2 API.
