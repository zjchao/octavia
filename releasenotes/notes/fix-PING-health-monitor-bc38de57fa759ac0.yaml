issues:
  - |
    Amphora images with HAProxy older than 1.6 (CentOS 7, etc.) will still
    use health monitor type TCP when PING is selected by the user.
upgrade:
  - |
    Amphora will need to be updated to a new image with this version of the
    agent and ping-wrapper.sh script prior to updating the Octavia controllers.
    If a load balancer is using a health monitor of type PING with an
    amphora image that has not been updated, the next configuration change to
    the load balancer will cause it to go into an ERROR state until it is
    failed over to an updated image.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where health monitors of type PING were really doing a
    TCP health check.
