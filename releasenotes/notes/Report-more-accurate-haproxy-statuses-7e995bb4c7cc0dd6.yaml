    Some versions of HAProxy incorrectly reported nodes in DRAIN status as
    being UP, and Octavia code was written around this incorrect reporting.
    This has been fixed in some versions of HAProxy and is now handled
    properly in Octavia as well. Now it is possible for members to be in the
    status DRAINING. Note that this is masked when statuses are forwarded to
    neutron-lbaas in the eventstream, so no compatibility change is necessary.
