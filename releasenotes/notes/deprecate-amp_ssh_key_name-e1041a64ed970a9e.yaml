features:
  - |
    New option in diskimage-create.sh `-n` to completely disable sshd on the
    amphora.
deprecations:
  - |
    Config option `amp_ssh_access_allowed` is deprecated, as it overlaps with
    `amp_ssh_key_name` in functionality and is not needed. Simply leave the
    variable `amp_ssh_key_name` blank and no ssh key will be installed. This
    is the same result as using `amp_ssh_access_allowed = False`.
security:
  - |
    It is now possible to completely remove sshd from the amphora image, to
    further lock down access and increase security. If this is set, providing
    an `amp_ssh_key_name` in config will install the key, but ssh access will
    not be possible as sshd will not be running.
