features:
  - |
    Users can now use a reference to a single PKCS12 bundle as their
    `default_tls_container_ref` instead of a Barbican container with
    individual secret objects. PKCS12 supports bundling a private key,
    certificate, and intermediates. Private keys can no longer be passphrase
    protected when using PKCS12 bundles.
    No configuration change is necessary to enable this feature. Users may
    simply begin using this. Any use of the old style containers will be
    detected and automatically fall back to using the old Barbican driver.

    Certificate bundles can now be stored in any backend Castellan supports,
    and can be retrieved via a Castellan driver, even if Barbican is not
    deployed.
security:
  - |
    Private keys can no longer be password protected, as PKCS12 does not
    support storing a passphrase in an explicitly defined way. Note that this
    is not noticeably less secure than storing a passphrase protected private
    key in the same place as the passphrase, as was the case with Barbican.
