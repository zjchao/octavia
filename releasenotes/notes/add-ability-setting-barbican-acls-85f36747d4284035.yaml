    Added ability for Octavia to automatically set Barbican ACLs on behalf of
    the user. Such enables users to create TLS-terminated listeners without
    having to add the Octavia keystone user id to the ACL list. Octavia will
    also automatically revoke access to secrets whenever load balancing
    resources no longer require access to them.
