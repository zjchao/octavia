features:
  - |
    Octavia now supports provider drivers. This allows third party load
    balancing drivers to be integrated with the Octavia v2 API. Users select
    the "provider" for a load balancer at creation time.
  - |
    There is now an API available to list enabled provider drivers.
upgrade:
  - |
    Two new options are included with provider driver support. The
    enabled_provider_drivers option defaults to "amphora, octavia" to support
    existing Octavia load balancers. The default_provider_driver option
    defaults to "amphora" for all new load balancers that do not specify a
    provider at creation time. These defaults should cover most existing
    deployments.
  - |
    The provider driver support requires a database migration and follows
    Octavia standard rolling upgrade procedures; database migration followed
    by rolling control plane upgrades. Existing load balancers with no
    provider specified will be assigned "amphora" as part of the database
    migration.
deprecations:
  - |
    The Octavia API handlers are now deprecated and replaced by the new
    provider driver support. Octavia API handlers will remain in the code to
    support the Octavia v1 API (used for neutron-lbaas).
  - |
    Provider of "octavia" has been deprecated in favor of "amphora" to clarify
    the provider driver supporting the load balancer.
other:
  - |
    A provider driver developer guide has been added to the documentation to
    aid driver providers.
  - |
    An operator documentation page has been added to list known Octavia
    provider drivers and provide links to those drivers.
    Non-reference drivers, drivers other than the "amphora" driver, will be
    outside of the octavia code repository but are dynamically loadable via
    a well defined interface described in the provider driver developers
    guide.
  - |
    Installed drivers need to be enabled for use in the Octavia
    configuration file once you are ready to expose the driver to users.
