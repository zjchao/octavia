features:
  - Added UDP protocol support to listeners and pools.
  - Adds a health monitor type of UDP-CONNECT that does a basic UDP port
    connect.
issues:
  - You cannot mix IPv4 UDP listeners with IPv6 members at this time. This is
    being tracked with this story

upgrade:
  - |
    UDP protocol support requires an update to the amphora image to support
    UDP protocol statistics reporting and UDP-CONNECT health monitoring.
other:
  - |
    Health monitors of type UDP-CONNECT may not work correctly if ICMP
    unreachable is not enabled on the member server or is blocked by a security
    rule. A member server may be marked as operating status ONLINE when it is
    actually down.
