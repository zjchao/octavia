    The compute zone (if applicable) is now cached in the database and returned
    in the Amphora API as `cached_zone`. Please note that this is only set at
    the original time of provisioning, and could be stale for various reasons
    (for example, if live-migrations have taken place due to maintenances). We
    recommend it be used for reference only, unless you are absolutey certain
    it is current in your environment. The source of truth is still the system
    you use for compute.
