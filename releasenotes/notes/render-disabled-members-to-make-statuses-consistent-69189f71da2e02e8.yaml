fixes:
  - |
    Creating a member on a pool with no healthmonitor would sometimes briefly
    update their operating status from `NO_MONITOR` to `OFFLINE` and back to
    `NO_MONITOR` during the provisioning sequence. This flapping will no longer
    occur.
  - |
    Members that are disabled via `admin_state_up=False` are now rendered in
    the HAProxy configuration on the amphora as `disabled`. Previously they
    were not rendered at all. This means that disabled members will now
    appear in health messages, and will properly change status to OFFLINE.
